# How to contribute

First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project. We've tried to make a stable project and try to fix bugs and add new features continuously. You can help us do more.

## Getting started

### Check out the roadmap

We have some functionalities in mind and we have issued them and added into the [Issues Board](https://github.com/Raspikabek/sfdocs-sfdx-plugin/issues). If there is a bug or a feature that is not listed in the **Issues** page or there is no one assigned to the issue, feel free to fix/add it!

### Writing some code!

Contributing to the project on Github is pretty straight forward. If this is you're first time, these are the steps you should take.

- Fork this repo.
- create a new `feature/<feature-name>` branch from `master`
- develop, test
- create a pull request to `master` on this repository

And that's it!

### Documentation

Every chunk of code that may be hard to understand has some comments above it. If you write some new code or change some part of the existing code in a way that it would not be functional without changing it's usages, it needs to be documented.

### Version control

This project follows the standards defined on https://semver.org/ for version control.

#### Summary

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,

MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and

PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
